##intro 
The Million Song Dataset is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks.
Most of the information is provided by The Echo Nest. The dataset is the result of a collaboration between The Echo Nest and LabROSA at Columbia University, supported in part by the NSF. (last update November 2015)


The data set consists of several subsets of various types of data:
- Million Song Dataset (280 GB) 
- SecondHandSongs dataset -> cover songs
- musiXmatch dataset -> lyrics
- Last.fm dataset -> song-level tags and similarity
- Taste Profile subset -> user data (3GB)
- thisismyjam-to-MSD mapping -> more user data
- tagtraum genre annotations -> genre labels
- Top MAGD dataset -> more genre labels
- There are even more additional data sets which can be bundled with the original data set. http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset
- For example, for some artists the longitude and langitude are known. http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/artist_location.txt

##Hypothesis

"Pandora was perhaps the frontrunner of combining the two when it started the 'Music Genome Project' way back in 1999 before terms like Big Data even existed. The project considers songs as datasets and analyzes each song using up to 450 distinct musical characteristics or “genes”. A person – a trained music analyst with an actual degree in music – and automated algorithms comb through the song and classify it as Pop/Rock, Hip-Hop/Electronica, Jazz, World Music, and Classical. Decoding the “genes” of the song helps Pandora find the similarities and then successfully predict what a user might like listening to next."

With Spotify's recent pruchase of Seed Scientific, the usage of data science for improving music curation is undeniable. Data science gives the power of curation and predition - two aspects of data which are continusously increasing in importance due to larger and larger datasets. 

The goal of this project is to predict the popularity of a song and curate the next song a user might like, not only based on musical attributes of the song, but also based on sentiment analysis of the lyrics.
